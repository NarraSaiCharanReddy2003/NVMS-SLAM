## Overview

NVMS-SLAM is a normal vector-based multi-session LiDAR SLAM system designed specifically for indoor environments. It leverages the power of LiDAR technology to create accurate maps and track the position of a device in real-time. This system is particularly useful in scenarios where GPS signals are weak or unavailable, such as inside buildings.

### Key Benefits
- **Accuracy**: High precision in mapping and localization.
- **Multi-Session Capability**: Supports the integration of multiple sessions for improved map quality.
- **Indoor Focus**: Optimized for indoor environments, making it suitable for various applications.

## Features

- **Real-Time Mapping**: Generates maps on-the-fly as the device moves.
- **Session Management**: Allows users to save and load previous sessions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands for ease of use.
- **Robust Performance**: Handles various indoor conditions effectively.
